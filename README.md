# Real-Time Text-to-Speech Interpreter

ðŸš€ **Introducing My New Python Project: Real-Time Text-to-Speech Interpreter!**

This Python project leverages the `pyttsx3` library to create a real-time text-to-speech interpreter. Users can input text and instantly hear it spoken aloud. 

## Features
- **Interactive Interface:** Continuously prompts the user to input text to be read aloud.
- **Easy Navigation:** Simple numeric inputs to continue or exit the program:
  - Press `1` to continue entering new text.
  - Press `2` to exit the program with a farewell message.
- **Graceful Exit:** The program informs the user via text-to-speech upon exiting.

## How It Works
1. Initializes the `pyttsx3` engine.
2. Enters a loop, waiting for user input.
3. Reads the entered text aloud.
4. Allows the user to continue or exit the loop.

## Requirements
- `pyttsx3`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RealTimeTextToSpeech.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pyttsx3
   ```

## Usage
Run the application:
```bash
python text_to_speech.py
```

## Future Enhancements
- Language selection
- Voice modulation
